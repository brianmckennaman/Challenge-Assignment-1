# Challenge-Assignment-1

The purpose of this assignment was to refactor the code provided to make it more accessible according to proper html semantic design.

To complete the task, I reworked the provided code, refactoring the html and adjusting the css style sheet accordingly.

The provided code is a mock-up of a company website landing page, featuring a nav bar in the header, a section with

Next, I consolidated several redundant css classes and id tags to be more consise.

All subsequent documents, including the html, css, and images files, were then uploaded to the "Activity Challenge 1" repository, which can be found here: https://github.com/brianmckennaman/Challenge-Assignment-1.
